# release-delivery-insights-examples

* The Digital.ai Release with Delivery Insights brings together Agile and DevOps to help you improve visibility and collaboration across software development and deliveries by seamlessly connecting the data and artifacts at each stage of the release to the related agile stories and features, allowing the whole organization to use a single tool to easily track progress end-to-end.
* Digital.ai Release version 10.1 supports integration with Continuum 21.???
* Digital.ai Release is our Release orchestrator and is more focused on the workflow – less on the contents of the flow, but more of the process. 
* Continuum continuously tracks the content: work items, commits, packages, versions and where they are in the development Value Stream. 
* The idea is to bring (integrate) them together, so that Release provides a rich insight in what is flowing through your development Value Stream. This combo of Release and Continuum is being offered as the Release with DevOps Insights solution. 
* Release will be the customer facing product; Continuum will be a headless server in the background. All Continuum functionality that we want to expose goes through Release in principle.

Here are a few Digital.ai Release templates that are readily available to simplify the process of configuring the Release—Continuum integration. 

## Templates included:

## Prerequisites

### Docker
You'll need to have Docker installed on your machine before you begin:

* Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/
* Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
* Linux: Refer to the instructions for your Linux distribution on how to install Docker

You may need to start the VPN client (Cisco AnyConnect) to be able to download the latest XL Release and XL Deploy Docker images.

### Continuum

A Continuum server v21.???? with `Delivery Insights` configuration enabled.

### Licenses

You need to bring your own Release license and copy it to the following location

* `docker/xl-release/default-conf/xl-release-license.lic`

License files are in `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed.

### Known limitations

- The Github connection on Release must use `token` instead of combination of username and password.

## Setup
### Configure passwords

Configure third-party passwords before starting XL Release.

Create a file `~/.xebialabs/secrets.xlvals`, paste in the following section and configure the passwords:

    
    jira_url = https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/
    jira_user = your_jira_user
    jira_password = your_jira_password
    
    github_token: your_github_token
    
    continuum_url: http://yourcompany.v1testdrive.com
    continuum_apiToken: your_continuum_api_token


## Start & stop

Start all Docker containers: 

    [Continuum]$ ./up.sh

Wait until running and then

    [Continuum]$ ./setup.sh
    
To tear down the entire demo:

    [Continuum]$ ./down.sh

## Exporting templates

If you edited the templates in the UI, you can export them using the following command.

    ./xlw generate xl-release -o -f out.yaml --path "Continuum Integration" --templates

Then manually pick and copy the relevant bits from `out.yaml` into `data/continuum-configuration.yaml`

## GitOps 

Slightly more advanced example of promoting templates and configuration through as-code/Git

Server 1:

    xl generate xl-release --configurations --file continuum-config.yaml -o
    xl generate xl-release --path "Continuum Integration" --templates --file continuum-demo.yaml -o
    
Revise, commit, review

Server 2:

Pull and then

    xl apply --xl-release-url http://localhost:5517 -f continuum-config.yaml -f continuum-demo.yaml 
    
    

## Accessing XL Release

Use http://localhost:5516/#/login as your entry point.
